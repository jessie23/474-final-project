                        <h3>Definition of a Dream:</h3>
                        <p>A series of thoughts, images, and sensations occurring in a person's mind during sleep.</p>
                        <h3>So...</h3>
                        <p>Dreaming is a cognitive experience that every person has had at some point in their life. However, it is perhaps the most misunderstood state of cognition that exists despite the extensive research that has been performed. Due to neuroscientific research, it is believed that dreaming occurs during REM (Rapid Eye Movement), the fifth stage in the sleep cycle. It is this sleep stage that is involved in the process of storing memories and stimulating the part of the brain that is responsible for learning. Therefore, it is in this stage of sleep when your brain is active, that dreams are formed. Now, letâ€™s learn more about the different parts of the brain that are used in dream formation. </p>

                    <p>When understanding the nature of dreams, we first must go back to the early 1900s and understand <b>Sigmund Freud</b>, who is considered the father of psychoanalysis and <em>The Dream Theory</em>. Freud began as a well-known psychologist, then began to analyze dreams in order to better understand personality traits that relate to pathology. His belief was that every action and thought is driven by your subconscious at some level. Typically, we have a tendency to hold back our urges and impulses. However, people with pathological tendencies must release these urges in some way, and Freud believed that one way is through dreams. He felt that when the content of the subconscious is be disturbing or harmful, the subconscious expresses itself in a <b>symbolic language</b> called dreaming.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>While Freud's work is considered revolutionary and the beginning of dream analysis, it was not until 1953 that researchers began to conduct studies on people and when they dream. They noticed that when subjects were woken from sleep during the phase of sleep characterized by "rapid, jerky, and binocularly symmetrical eye movements" they recalled the most vivid and elaborate dreams. However, when subjects were awoken from non-REM sleep, there were less reports that were also less intense. From here, the <b>REM (Rapid Eye Movement)</b> state emerged, and has been associated with dreaming ever since.

                <h3>How dreams flow through the brain</h3>
                <h4>1. Pontine Region of the Brain Stem</h4>
                <p>A dream begins here. This part of the brain controls sensory roles in hearing, equilibrium,
                and taste, as well as motor roles in eye movementsment, facial expressions, and the secretion of saliva and tears.</p>
                <h4>2. Temporal Limbic Area</h4>
                <p>It processes sensory input into meanings for visual memory retention, language comprehension,
                    and emotion association.</p>
                <h4>3. Ventromedial Area</h4>
                <p>This part of the brain plays a part in emotional responses and decision making.</p>
                <h4>4. Medial Limbic Area</h4>
                <p>This is the next part of the brain that becomes active in dream formation. It is responsible for detecting odors,
                sensing fear, and retaining declarative memories. A declarative memory is a long-term memory composed of facts, figures, and names that a person has learned.</p>
                <h4>5. Inferior Parietal Lobes</h4>
                <p>They perceive emotions in facial stimuli and interpret sensory information, playing a huge role in how senses are incorporated into dreams.</p>
                <h4>6. Occipito-Temporal Area</h4>
                <p>The final part of the brain used in dream formation is the Occipito-Temporal area, which helps in identifying things such as colors, movements,
                and written communication.</p>

                        While it is not a proven fact, studies indicate that simple dream imagery is formed in the brain stem and is then sent to the sensory cortex, which translates the dream into a longer, more complex story. We do know, however, that dreams are created naturally by the subconscious mind. Your subconscious creates dreams from <b>Schemata</b> you have built up from your experience and understanding of the world. A Schema is an abstract mental structure, like a set of rules, which organizes our knowledge and understanding of the world. It is your expectations of what things are and what things should be.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                        This process begins with a single idea or image coming to mind and is typically linked to whatever thought was in your mind as you were falling asleep. In this example, letâ€™s say this image was a <b>pencil</b>.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <div><img src="img/girldreaming.png" class="img-responsive wow slideInRight" id="girldreaming"/></div>
                        <p>
                        Now your mind will begin to build a dream using the set of schemata that you unconsciously associate with a pencil:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>When you think of a pencil your schema says you most commonly use a pencil when sitting at a desk, so this detail is added into the dream.</li>
                            <li>When you think of sitting at a desk you think of being at school.</li>
                            <li>When you think of being at school, you think of being in an exam and feeling anxious.</li>
                        </ol>
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                        Using the schemata above and starting from that one idea of a pencil, your mind has created a dream (or a nightmare), where you are back in school, feeling anxious and possibly running around the building trying to escape.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This is how all dreams are created and how they evolve and progress. Your mind simply adds in the content of rich visual images and a storyline to your internal expectations of what should occur.
